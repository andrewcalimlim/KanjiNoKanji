Today I learned after signing up for a remywiki account and after trying to figure out
Pywikibot (a bot for using MediaWiki's API) that all I need from Remywiki is a simple
API request, one that doesn't need a bot since I will not be editing the wiki, just
making queries (like hey does this kanji look familiar to you? ã€†)

Anyways, here is how you make a query about pages in remywiki

https://remywiki.com/api.php?action=query&format=json&prop=&titles=[KANJI]

[KANJI] at the end is replaced with whatever kanji ah titles you wanna search

a json file is returned to you and in query > pages are the list (probably 1) of pageids
of matching pages, if it's -1 there's no matching valid title.

so let's say we searched for shime, (the kanji i asked at the end of paragraph 1).
This query returns one pageid: 31192. Dope, now what? Now, we link to a Remywiki page by
doing the following:

https://remywiki.com/?curid=31192 <--- the ID at the end here

Let the redirects or whatever do their thing. It's not like you're being paid to do this.


Update: while being super dehydrated (love being diabetic in my 20s!) I figured out
how to use Gson locally (cause I want to get the back-end functionality done before
I begin designing the front-end in Android Studio). Tried figuring out Maven, realized
it's way too complicated of a tool to use right now. Learned how to include a JAR file
in my programs.

Now Gson is running! Will begin using it tomorrow.

Sigh...

One crazy Canadian road trip, dodging high school-level third-wheels, and an impromptu
cardio session later...I still haven't figured out how to convert RemyWiki's produced JSON
file into an object. This is because the JSON has nested objects (common) but also object IDs
as object names. This is hard.

On the bright side, I think I found a solution...kinda but its for C#.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32552705/deserialize-json-object-structure-with-ids-as-keys

I did learn more about JSON serialization (object -> JSON) and JSON deserialization (JSON -> Object)

I also learned that no matter what, you must have a Java class designed for the JSON file either way.

Thankfully, I also learned that Java classes don't always have to be super lengthy and boilerplate.
In fact, this concept is known as Plain Old Java Object, or POJO.

Options:
#1: Try this solution, but abstracted to use with Java
#2: Switch project to Android Studio and run Jackson instead of Gson lol
#3: fucc proper json processing, just search string for pageid and get that

Aight... well good night. Hopefully tomorrow will be better in terms of progress. Maybe I'll ask some
people online too.

PS: Oh I looked at the TODO list and learned that I did the first step...convert the URL into a JSON file!
Mainly by googling and copy pasting (hey i cited my sources) tho lol

Also today was a good day regardless, idk why i'm so down. Now if I could only find out why my head has so
much pressure rn....

Alright. I finally converted the json file into a remywiki page link!
Problem is that I had to switch to Jackson to use the model tree and I am using a model tree
object instead of actually converting the json file into a proper object equivalent. Oh, and I'm
on Android Studio now. Cause it's too much of a pain to run a JSON handling package on Windows.

Download the jar from maven, add it to PATH..., honestly Android Studio just runs it easier.

As for accessing RemyWiki.. I might return to this in the future when I want to get the actual translated title of the page on
remywiki / the proper pronounciation in the future. that's a stretch goal. Or I might try to
convert it as an exercise in learning JSON deserialization/serialization.

Again, if I was being paid I would look into this further.

Or maybe I should do that tomorrow? The page just redirects my links to the page with the title
romanized in the URL. Hmmm...

Tomorrow as in Monday? lmao god

I'm happy I worked on this. It makes hanging out with my friends a lot more substantive. Speaking
of which...
