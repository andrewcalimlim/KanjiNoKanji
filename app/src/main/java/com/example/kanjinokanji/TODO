welcome back gamer

current issue:

kanji is being detected on score photos
i think

but the kanji spacing needs to be exact, and possibly strip away any
latin words

test the spacing by checking all possible spacings? (possibly inefficient)

but yeah detection aight, GJ!

aight refactor this to a separate function so u can test several images
at a time

and maybe show them on screen? nahhh

another example of needing to "check" the ml-text recognizer:

「罪過の聖堂 needs to be 罪過の聖堂
表裏一旗!?怪盗いいんちょの悩みケ should be a unicode heart lol maybe just
tell the user to crop any unicode hearts or ish like that idk

or to edit the text before sending it off to search

which might involve detecting japanese characters (kana or Han i guess)

#3.75 Perform a "checker" for the text recognizer results to strip any punctuation, latin

#4: implement image to text to remywiki URL in Android Studio!

--back end complete--

#5: Design and implement front-end! TBD
