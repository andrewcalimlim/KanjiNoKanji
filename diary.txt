Today I learned after signing up for a remywiki account and after trying to figure out
Pywikibot (a bot for using MediaWiki's API) that all I need from Remywiki is a simple
API request, one that doesn't need a bot since I will not be editing the wiki, just 
making queries (like hey does this kanji look familiar to you? ã€†)

Anyways, here is how you make a query about pages in remywiki

https://remywiki.com/api.php?action=query&format=json&prop=&titles=[KANJI]

[KANJI] at the end is replaced with whatever kanji ah titles you wanna search

a json file is returned to you and in query > pages are the list (probably 1) of pageids 
of matching pages, if it's -1 there's no matching valid title.

so let's say we searched for shime, (the kanji i asked at the end of paragraph 1).
This query returns one pageid: 31192. Dope, now what? Now, we link to a Remywiki page by
doing the following:

https://remywiki.com/?curid=31192 <--- the ID at the end here

Let the redirects or whatever do their thing. It's not like you're being paid to do this.


Update: while being super dehydrated (love being diabetic in my 20s!) I figured out
how to use Gson locally (cause I want to get the back-end functionality done before
I begin designing the front-end in Android Studio). Tried figuring out Maven, realized
it's way too complicated of a tool to use right now. Learned how to include a JAR file
in my programs.

Now Gson is running! Will begin using it tomorrow.
